How to use Bakery Program:

Before using the program you should put the files “bakeryItems.txt” and “orders.txt” in the folder where the “src” folder is located (not inside). 
When you run the program you will see a menu with these options: 
1.) to use CCS provided data. (The program will read the files “bakeryItems.txt” and “orders.txt.”)
2.) to use resulting data from last runthrough (the program will read the files “ordersSave.txt” and “bakeryItemsSave.txt” which will be created automatically when you have created and saved a list of orders (From option 1). 
3.) Provide a new dataset (You can input your own file)

Once you read a file. 
For example, if you enter “1” the program will read the files “bakeryItems.txt” and “orders.txt.” You will see these two options:
1.) Cashier Interface (The cashier can only perform Transaction)
2.) Owner Interface (The owner can perform any action)

If you enter “2”, you will see all these available actions: 
ORDERS
1.) Add New Order
2.) View Existing Orders
3.) Update Existing Order

CUSTOMERS
4.) Add New Customer
5.) View Existing Customer Information
6.) Update Existing Customer Info

INVENTORY
7.) Add Inventory Item
8.) View All Items in Inventory
9.) Update Inventory Items
10.) Save and Quit

When you finish using the program you can enter “10” to Save and Quit. This will create the files “ordersSave.txt” and “bakeryItemsSave.txt” that you can load next time you use the program (Option “2” from main menu).
