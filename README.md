==========

Final Project for CS3500 Object Oriented Design

Our group opted for custom OOD based structures for Inventory, CustomerRoll, and OrderRoll. Ironically, this was a bad decision. The code which have been more compact, efficient, and cleaner if we had just used arraylists for most items. There are lots of redundant function calls passed down from Bakery to the individual objects.

TL;DR - Turned into a last minute spaghetti scramble to get the assignment in on time due to the unnecessary scope. Not my best work...
